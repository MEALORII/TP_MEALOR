    "We consider the problem of a single-edge notched beam in bending (SENB). It consists of a beam of span $2L$ and height $H$, simply supported on two roller-pinned supports and loaded by a concentrated vertical load at the top at its center. A vertical pre-crack is inserted from the bottom face at its center in the form of an initial notch of width $2e$ and height $h$. For symmetry reasons, we model only the right-half of the specimen.\n",
