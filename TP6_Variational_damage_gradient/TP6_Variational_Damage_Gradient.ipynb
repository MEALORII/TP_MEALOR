In `damage_gradient.py`, define using UFL operators the following functions:\n","* `sigma(v, d)` computing the damaged elastic stress as a function of `u`. You can use the already-define `eps(v)` function for the strain and `sigma0(v)` for the non-damaged stress.\n","* `g(d)` computing the degradation function as a function of a damage field `d`. You can use the already-defined residual stiffness constant `kres`.\n","* `psi(v, d)` computing the damaged elastic strain energy density as a function of `u` and `d`\n","* the forms `elastic_energy` and `fracture_energy` corresponding to $\\mathcal{E}_\\text{el}$ and $\\mathcal{E}_\\text{frac}$ as a function of the unknown displacement `u` and damage field `d`\n","\n","2. Run the simulation to check the behaviour of the homogeneous solution for both AT1 and AT2 models.\n","\n","\n","## Localized 1D solutions\n","\n","We consider the same problem with $\\ell_0 = 0.1$ and now `refinement_level=4`.\n","A refinement of level `k` yields a mesh with an element size of roughly $2^{-k}L$.\n","1. Launch the computation for AT1 and `Umax=3e-3`. What happens ?\n","2. Rerun the computation by imposing now `damage_bcs=True`. This keyword enforces the damage field to be zero at both extremities where displacement is fixed. What happens ?\n","3. What is the value of the dissipated energy ? What value do you expect theoretically for a localized solution ? Report the value of the dissipated energy for `refinement_level=5,6,7` and comment.\n","4. Do the same with $\\ell_0 = 0.02$ and `Umax=5e-3`. Compare with the previous case.\n","5. Now, what happens for the AT2 model ?\n","\n","\n","## Notched tension\n","We now consider `refinement_level=0`, `Umax=2.5e-3` and `damage_bcs=False`. We also change the problem type to `problem=\"notched\"` corresponding to a similar plate in tension (same boundary conditions), of dimensions $L × H = 1 × 0.5$, perforated by two notches of radius $R=$`notch_radius`, horizontal spacing (`notch_spacing`) and aspect ratio (`aspect_ratio`).\n","\n","1. We take $R = 0.2$ and $\\ell_0 = 0.1$. Run the computation for AT2 and comment. What happens upon mesh refinement?\n","2. What can we say for $\\ell_0 = 0.05, 0.025$ ?\n","3. Now change to $R = 0.2$ and `aspect_ratio=100`. What is the influence of $\\ell_0$ in this case compared to the previous case ?\n","\n","\n","## Cracking in mode II\n","We now consider `problem=\"shear\"` with $L=H=1$.\n","This problem corresponds to a shear loading of a cut-out block by applying an horizontal\n","displacement on the top face, the bottom face being fixed. The pre-crack is therefore loaded\n","initially in mode II.\n","\n","1. First change the boundary conditions accordingly: `facets=2` is the bottom boundary, `facets=4` is the top boundary. Run the computation for the AT1 model with $\\ell_0 = 0.04$, `Nincr = 50` and `Umax=6e-3`. What can we observe regarding the crack path ? \n","2. By considering how the top block\n","moves, what can you say about the top crack ? What should happen in reality ?\n","3. Amor et al. proposed the following tension/compression splitting model:\n","\\begin{align}\n","\\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon},d) &= g(d)\\psi_+(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) + \\psi_-(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\\\\n","\\psi_+(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) &= \\dfrac{1}{2}\\kappa\\langle\\textrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\rangle_+^2 + \\mu\\textrm{dev}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}):\\textrm{dev}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\\\\n","\\psi_-(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) &= \\dfrac{1}{2}\\kappa\\langle\\textrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\rangle_-^2 \n","\\end{align}\n","Adapt the value of the elastic energy using the functions `psi_pos` and `psi_neg` and run again the simulation with this model.\n","\n","4. What happens when using the AT2 model ? What can we expect upon mesh refinement and smaller regularization length ?"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"c9383ad2-51c4-47fd-ba48-6f43ee5fc623","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from damage_gradient import solve_problem\n","from mealor.utils import plot_over_line\n","from mealor.plotting import plot_mesh\n","from generate_mesh import setup_geometry\n","\n","L = 1.0\n","H = 0.1\n","problem_type = \"bar\"\n","domain, facets = setup_geometry(problem_type, L, H, refinement_level=0)\n","plot_mesh(domain)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"4ad5195d","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Material parameters\n","E = 3.0e3\n","nu = 0.3\n","Gc = 3e-3\n","l0 = 0.1\n","model = \"AT1\"\n","Nincr = 50\n","Umax = 5e-3\n","mech_params = (E, nu, Gc, l0, model, Umax, Nincr)\n","\n","# boundary conditions\n","damage_bcs = True\n","def generate_bcs(dirichlet, Uimp):\n","    # ux = Uimp on right boundary\n","    dirichlet.add_bc_topological(facets, 3, ux=Uimp)\n","    # ux = 0 on left boundary\n","    dirichlet.add_bc_topological(facets, 1, ux=0)    \n","    # uy = 0 on x=y=0 point\n","    dirichlet.add_bc_geometrical(\n","        lambda x: np.logical_and(np.isclose(x[0], 0), np.isclose(x[1], 0)), uy=0\n","        )\n","    \n","# Alternate minimization parameters\n","Niter_max = 100 \n","tol = 1e-6\n","\n","prob_params = (problem_type, generate_bcs, damage_bcs, Niter_max, tol)\n","results, u, d, sig = solve_problem(\n","    domain, facets, prob_params, mech_params\n",")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"0455ec8b","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["Uimp = results[:, 0]\n","Force = results[:, 1]\n","elastic = results[:, 2]\n","fracture = results[:, 3]\n","\n","S0 = 0.1\n","print(\"Final dissipated energy [/Gc)]\", fracture[-1]/Gc)\n","print(f\"Maximum stress {max(Force/S0)}\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6a2e3826","metadata":{},"source":["### Plot stress curve and energies"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"43a29cdd-fee6-45cc-8da3-cd476327ac13","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["plt.plot(Uimp/L, Force/S0, '-k')\n","plt.xlabel(\"Average strain\")\n","plt.ylabel(\"Average stress\")\n","plt.show()\n","\n","plt.figure()\n","plt.plot(Uimp/L, elastic, label=\"elastic\")\n","plt.plot(Uimp/L, fracture, label=\"fracture\")\n","plt.plot(Uimp/L, elastic + fracture, label=\"total\")\n","plt.xlabel(\"Average strain\")\n","plt.ylabel(\"Energies\")\n","plt.legend()\n","plt.show()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"fb857207","metadata":{},"source":["### Plot localized solution profiles"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"73d14aa7","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["line = [(0., H / 2), (1.0, H / 2)]\n","dv, points = plot_over_line(d, line, domain)\n","x = points[:, 0]\n","\n","pos = lambda x: (x+np.abs(x))/2.0\n","\n","profile = {\"AT2\": np.exp(-np.abs(x - L / 2) / l0),\n","            \"AT1\": (pos(1-np.abs(x-L/2)/2/l0))**2}\n","\n","plt.plot(x, dv, \"-\", label=\"damage profile\")\n","plt.xlabel(r\"$x$\")\n","plt.ylabel(r\"Damage $d$\")\n","plt.ylim(0, 1)\n","plt.plot(x, profile[model], \"--r\", label=f\"{model} theoretical profile\")\n","plt.legend()\n","plt.show()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"d6358998","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
